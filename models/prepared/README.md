# Staged Data Documentation

## Overview
The Staged area of our DBT project serves as a critical intermediate layer where data is refined and prepared for further analysis and reporting. This area is designed to cleanse, transform, and enrich raw data, making it suitable for more complex transformations in the warehouse and marts.

## Contents
The staged models include a variety of datasets that normalize and integrate raw data from disparate sources:

- **stg_audience_segments.sql**: Transforms audience segment data to support targeted marketing efforts.
- **stg_consumers.sql**: Cleanses and consolidates consumer information to create a unified consumer profile.
- **stg_interactions.sql**: Structures interaction data across multiple channels for comprehensive analysis.
- **stg_inventory.sql**: Standardizes inventory data to monitor stock levels and movements accurately.
- **stg_items.sql**: Enriches item data with additional attributes for detailed product analysis.
- **stg_location_dimension.sql**: Formats and enhances location data for geographical analysis.
- **stg_loyalty_activities.sql**: Aggregates loyalty program activities to evaluate customer engagement and program effectiveness.
- **stg_media_channels.sql**: Prepares media channel data to assess the performance of various advertising efforts.
- **stg_offers.sql**: Organizes promotional offer data to analyze usage and effectiveness.
- **stg_orders.sql**: Processes order data to track sales transactions and customer purchasing behavior.
- **stg_sales.sql**: Aggregates sales data to provide insights into sales trends and performance metrics.
- **stg_shops.sql**: Integrates data from multiple shop locations to analyze operational efficiency.
- **stg_suppliers.sql**: Centralizes supplier data to enhance supply chain management.
- **stg_touchpoints.sql**: Collects customer touchpoint data to improve customer journey mapping.

## Data Integration
Staged data is sourced from operational systems such as ERP, CRM, and e-commerce platforms. This layer ensures data consistency and reliability, which are crucial for downstream processes.

## Usage
The models in the Staged area are used for:
- **Data Cleansing**: Removing inaccuracies and preparing data for analytical use.
- **Data Enrichment**: Enhancing data with additional context and consolidating information from multiple sources.
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring data integrity before it is moved to more permanent storage in the warehouse or marts.

## Maintenance
- **Data Refresh Schedule**: Staged data is refreshed in real-time or batch processes depending on the source system capabilities and business requirements.
- **Change Management**: Updates to staging models are handled through a controlled process that includes data validation checks, peer reviews, and regression tests.

## Support and Contributions
- For support or to report issues with staged data processes, contact the Data Engineering team at `dataengineering@examplecorp.com`.
- Contributions to staged models must adhere to our coding standards and are subject to a thorough review process to maintain data quality and consistency.

This README is crafted to provide detailed insights into the operations of the Staged area, fostering transparency and collaboration among teams that rely on this pivotal data layer.
