# Data Marts Directory Documentation

## Overview
The Data Marts directory within our DBT project contains models that aggregate and transform data into specific formats designed for different business units and analytical purposes. This documentation provides an overview of each subdirectory, detailing the intended use and the business questions each data mart aims to answer.

## Purpose
Data marts are created to support specific business functions by providing streamlined, accessible, and business-specific views on our data warehouse. These models are optimized to speed up data retrieval and improve the performance of business intelligence tools.

## Structure
The `marts` directory is segmented into subdirectories, each representing a different business area or analytical focus. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the current subdirectories and their purposes:

### Subdirectories:
- **data_analyst**: Contains models tailored for deep data analysis and reporting, used primarily by our data analysts.
- **marketing**: Features models designed to track marketing performance and campaign analytics.

## Usage
The models within these subdirectories are used to:
- **Support Business Decisions**: By providing tailored datasets that answer specific business questions.
- **Enhance Reporting**: Through datasets optimized for reporting tools, facilitating regular reporting cycles.
- **Drive Insights**: By enabling data discovery and deeper analytical investigations into specific business areas.

## Model Lifecycle
- **Development**: Models are prototyped and developed based on business requirements and data availability.
- **Testing**: Rigorous testing ensures accuracy and reliability before models are moved to production.
- **Deployment**: After approval, models are deployed and scheduled to run at predefined intervals to refresh the data marts.

## Maintenance
- **Regular Reviews**: To ensure continued relevance and accuracy, models are reviewed quarterly to consider any necessary updates or optimizations.
- **Issue Resolution**: Any issues identified in the data marts are addressed promptly to minimize impact on downstream reports and decisions.

## Contributing
- **Improvements**: Suggestions for improving existing models or ideas for new marts are always welcome. Please coordinate with the Data Engineering team for design and integration.
- **Collaboration**: Contributions from various departments ensure that our data marts remain aligned with evolving business needs.

## Contact
- **Support**: For technical support or questions about the data marts, please contact `data-support@examplecorp.com`.
- **Feedback**: For feedback or suggestions, please use our internal feedback tools or contact the BI team directly.

This README is intended to ensure that all team members, regardless of their familiarity with the data architecture, can understand and leverage the data marts effectively for their needs.
