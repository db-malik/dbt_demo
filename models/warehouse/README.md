# Warehouse Data Documentation

## Overview
The Warehouse section in our DBT project encapsulates crucial aggregated data and dimensions central to our analytical operations across various departments. This data facilitates deep-dive analyses and supports complex decision-making processes.

## Contents
The warehouse consists of several fact tables and dimensional models, each serving specific analytical needs:

- **wh_fact_sales.sql**: Aggregates sales data to provide a comprehensive view of sales transactions across all channels, allowing for detailed revenue analysis and trend assessment.

- **wh_fact_inventory.sql**: Maintains records of inventory movements and levels, essential for managing stock efficiently and planning procurement.

- **wh_fact_interactions.sql**: Tracks customer interactions across all touchpoints, providing insights into customer behavior and engagement patterns.

- **wh_fact_loyalty.sql**: Analyzes customer loyalty metrics, helping to refine customer retention strategies and loyalty program effectiveness.

- **wh_dim_consumer.sql**: A dimensional model that provides a unified view of consumer data, enhancing demographic and psychographic segmentation.

- **wh_dim_media_channels.sql**: Categorizes media channel data to assist in evaluating the effectiveness of different advertising channels.

- **wh_dim_offers.sql**: Analyzes promotional offers to assess their impact on sales and customer engagement.

- **wh_dim_audience_segments.sql**: Segments audience data to support targeted marketing and personalized communication strategies.

- **wh_dim_product.sql**: Offers a detailed view of product performance metrics, aiding in product development and lifecycle management.

- **wh_dim_location.sql**: Geographical data model supporting regional sales performance analysis and market penetration strategies.

## Data Integration
This warehouse integrates data from various operational systems, including sales, CRM, inventory management, and marketing automation tools, to provide a holistic view of the organization's operational performance.

## Usage
The models in the Warehouse are primarily used for:
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitoring and analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) across different business units.
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Providing data-driven insights to support strategic planning and execution.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Identifying opportunities for improving operational efficiency and reducing costs.

## Maintenance
- **Data Refresh Schedule**: Warehouse data is refreshed on a daily basis during off-peak hours to ensure minimal disruption to operational activities.
- **Change Management**: Any changes to the warehouse models undergo a rigorous testing and approval process, coordinated by the Data Engineering team.
